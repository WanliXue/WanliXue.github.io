## Dealing with VMware on PC and different MacOS
---

Seems VMware has different name on PC and Mac, for PC is comes as VMware and Mac VMfusion. Acutally ther are same. The image/VM files can be copied and used
on the Mac VMfusion directly by: rename the file folder extension to .vmwarevm.

#### For mac:

For the newest version of VMfusion, it both can be used on Macmojave or earlier MacOS.

Just allow it on Secruity & Privacy. One thing stuck me for a while is : new Mojave system wont remind you to allow in in System > Security&Privacy >Gernal, 
but dirrectly comes with a error. Finally, I found it is this issue. Solved.
