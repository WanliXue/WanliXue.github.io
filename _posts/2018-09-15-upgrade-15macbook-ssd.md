Macbook pro 15 mid year seems to be the last version can update ssd byself,
however the interface seems not compatible with normal SATA interface (M2?)
Apple use a customized ssd interface design, so most of SSD even M2 cannot be directly used on this mac.
Most ssd has NVMe M.2 PCIe standard interface but different interface to Apple's.

There is two possible solutions.


1. [OWC](https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/ssd/owc/macbook-pro-retina-display/2013-2014-2015)
--only used OWC ssd

2. cheapter but with extra trasfer intersection, [知乎](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/35806613)
--sumsang SM951a tested

This is the details about choosing [OWC](http://www.cnfeat.com/blog/2016/07/18/MacbookProSSDUpdate/)

After a re-research during weekend, I decided to do the DIY plan instead of OWC plan,
the statements which support me is from [macrumours](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/upgrading-2013-2014-macbook-pro-ssd-to-m-2-nvme.2034976/page-64#post-26210298).

And I almost decide to make the order about the adapter mentioned above from [here](http://eshop.sintech.cn/ngff-m2-pcie-ssd-card-as-2013-2014-2015-macbook-ssd-p-1143.html)
