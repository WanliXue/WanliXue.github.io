# writing improvement for CS paper (shared by Wen)

1) Be consistent in your writing style
2) Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating,
non-committal language.
3) Use formal words like may, furthermore, significant ... instead of
can, besides, a lot
4) Use the active voice instead of passive one.
5) How to cite.
